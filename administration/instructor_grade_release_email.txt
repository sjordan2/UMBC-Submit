Well how do you do, oh great and powerful course administrator?

The grades for {{assignment_name}} have been released to students.

Here are some statistics for the entire course:

Maximum Points Possible: {{max_points}}

Number of Students in Course: {{total_num_students}}
Class Average: {{total_average}}
Class Median: {{total_median}}
Class Standard Deviation: {{total_sd}}

Eventually, there will be statistics for the specific parts of the assignment, but Sean is lazy and has MATH 301 homework to do. :(

The CMSC 201 Empire thanks you for being a faithful servant to the cause.

Sincerely,
