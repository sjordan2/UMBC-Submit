- Add feature that emails TAs when a student's extension is done and they can start grading
- Remake the email GUI on the user management page - allow option to email specific students and not all new ones
- Add ability to configure late policy for a course
- Add way to determine how late a assignment was submitted (if the late policy allows for it)
- Add ability for students to "self-grant" 'n' extensions before they have to request an extension from the instructors
- Add feature that emails instructors whenever something fishy happens (suspicious activity with auth keys or what not)
COMPLETED - Sean, 5/21/21 - Make an option to toggle visibility of assignment to students
- Make stringent requirements so that the rubric can't be completed unless the points total up nicely
- Make it so that a recently created assignment can't be made visible to students unless the sample makefile, parts, etc. have all been set up
- Decorate the home screen with something (announcements, assignments, logo, embedded course calendar, recent video lectures [embed Youtube?])
- Incorporate the nav bar into the assignment and user management pages
- Revamp the file upload for student rosters - show progress with AJAX, as well as show errors for specific students in a good way
- Allow assignments/parts to have tildes in them.. and maybe underscores?
SUPER IMPORTANT - Get this transferred to a server that has docker on it so we don't have to SSH each time
- Add a linux command line boot camp (or keep it as a lab?) - maybe make another boot camp for basic programming skills?
- Add ability for TA/instructor to be in charge of two different sections
- Change how TA/Instructor rubrics are handled/displayed (like what happens if the TA clicks "view grades")
- Add way to separate major/nonmajor sections
- Make our own MOSS?
- Get Min to work on the frontend and make it look pretty - maybe bribe him with cookies?
- Switch over whatever Blackboard uses instead of CAS (so it doesn't ask for authentication every time you switch pages)
- Implement AJAX loading bar when testing code
- Show upcoming assignments? Maybe incorporate this into the course calendar if implemented..
- Drag and drop feature for uploading code? And maybe for uploading makefiles/IO files? Maybe allow copy-pasting code and submitting?
- Send students notifications when new assignments are released, and maybe a few days before they are due?
- Maybe make an edit option in the view submission page?
- Make graph of test cases passing or failing <-- this would be very unforgiving..
- Send students emails confirming submissions?
- Add way for instructors to download grades in Blackboard-uploadable format

- Clean up codebase (and probably redo the whole frickin thing lmao)
- Do a security review
